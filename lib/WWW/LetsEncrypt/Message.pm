=head1 NAME

WWW::LetsEncrypt::Message - Base class for all ACME messages.

=head1 SYNPOSIS

	package Some::Acme::Message;

	use Moose;
	extends 'WWW::LetsEncrypt::Message';

	# implement functions required functions
	...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an abstract class that provides the basis for ACME messages being sent
to the Let's Encrypt CA server.

=head2 Attributes

=over 4

=item _acme_base_url

private attribute that holds the ACME API URL. Defaults to the
Let's Encrypt API URL, cannot be changed once the object has been created.

=item JWK

JSON Web Key object that implements both JWK and JWA (will be passed to
a JWS object). This is required.

=item nonce

scalar attribute that holds the nonce. It will be used when sending
messages, and will be automatically refreshed upon receiving a message from
the Let's Encrypt CA server. This attribute is not required but messages w/o
a valid nonce may fail!

=item retry_time

scalar integer attribute that holds how much time the client
should wait before trying to send another API request. This value being true
usually means an HTTP 429 was encountered and that the client should back off.

=item WebAgent

object attribute that holds an instance of LWP::UserAgent (or
anything that happens to implement the same functions). If not provided during
initialization, a new LWP::UserAgent object will be created with the following
settings:

=over 4

=item protocols allows: https

=item agent: LE-Bot (libwww-perl)

=item ssl_option: verify_hostname => true

# the Message object is currently performing.

# '_uri' private attribute that potentially holds the URL for the next step,

# generated and must be followed.

=head2 Functions

=over 4

=item $Obj->do_request()

This method is the primary method that a client should use to perform message
calls out to an ACME server.  It performs some error handling, but passes all
major processing off to a derived class's _process_request function.

Output

	\%hash_ref = {
		successful => boolean value that expresses if a step performed successfully,
		finished   => boolean value that expresses if all steps have been performed,
		error      => boolean value that expresses a FATAL error has occurred,
		...
		(other values depending on step)
	}
